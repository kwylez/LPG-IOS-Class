## iOS Class - Spring 2015

Each class will have two subfolders: **Examples** and **Presentations**. The presentations are PDF's so there shouldn't be any special software required. The examples **do require** Xcode to run them. If you know how to use git then you can just clone the repo and then `git pull` when updates are available. If aren't comfortable or don't know or what git is then you can download the zip file by clicking on the button to the right that says **Download Zip**.
